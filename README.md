# Introduction

[Commitspark](https://commitspark.com) is a set of tools to manage structured data with Git
through a GraphQL API.

This package provides interfaces that abstract away concrete Git repository storage locations from
the [Commitspark GraphQL API](https://github.com/commitspark/graphql-api) implementation. Implement these interfaces
to support a custom Git repository storage that is not already covered by one of the adapters provided by Commitspark.
